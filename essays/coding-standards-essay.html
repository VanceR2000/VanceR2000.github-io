    <p>When the term <em>“coding standards”</em> comes up in conversation, it often gets eye rolls and groans. Most people immediately think of trivial arguments—tabs vs. spaces, where to put curly braces, or how many blank lines should go between functions. But dismissing coding standards as just personal style preferences overlooks how important they really are.</p>

    <p>Coding standards go far beyond aesthetics. They help keep code clear, consistent, and easy to maintain. They improve team collaboration and even serve as a tool for learning. If I had to pick just one software engineering practice to improve code quality on a team or project, I’d choose setting up—and actually following—solid coding standards.</p>


    <h2>A Built-in Teacher (That Doesn’t Sugarcoat Things)</h2>
    <p>This past week, I started using ESLint in VS Code, and I was surprised by how much I learned. ESLint didn’t just highlight errors—it explained why certain code wasn’t ideal. It flagged unused variables, questionable conditionals, and redundant snippets. It even caught moments when I unknowingly wrote code more like C than JavaScript.</p>

    <p>At first, I took it a little personally. Seeing red underlines everywhere felt like I was doing everything wrong. Fixing the warnings was tedious, and honestly, kind of annoying. But eventually, something clicked. I started to see those warnings as mini-lessons built right into my editor. I could predict what ESLint would flag, and my code slowly became cleaner, more organized, and easier to understand. It felt like I was learning the language faster just by paying attention to the feedback.</p>

    <h2>It’s Not Just About You—It’s About the Team</h2>
    <p>They're also crucial for teamwork. When everyone writes code the same way, it’s easier to read, easier to debug, and easier to share. Without a standard, it feels like every file was written in a different dialect. With one, a project feels unified, like a story told by a single voice instead of a dozen competing ones.</p>

    <h2>Painful? Yes. Useful? Absolutely.</h2>
    <p>Sure, ESLint can be frustrating—just like going to the gym, learning an instrument, or debugging beyond "Hello World." But that discomfort is part of growth. The friction between old habits and new best practices is what helps us get better. Eventually, those best practices feel natural, and writing good code becomes faster and more confident.</p>

    <h2>Bigger Than Just Braces and Spaces</h2>
    <p>Strong coding standards cover more than formatting. They touch on naming conventions, function structure, documentation, architecture, and error handling. When used with tools like ESLint or Prettier, they don’t just guide—they reinforce. You don’t have to memorize every rule because the system gently reminds you along the way.</p>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>In the end, coding standards aren’t just rules—they’re a foundation. They shape how we think about programming, how we work with others, and how we grow. Debates about spaces versus tabs will probably never go away, but the real power of standards is in what they teach us and how they help us build something bigger than ourselves.</p>

    <p><strong>That’s why I believe coding standards aren’t optional—they’re essential.</strong></p>
