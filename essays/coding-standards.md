When the term “coding standards” comes up in conversation, it often gets eye rolls and groans. Most people immediately think of trivial arguments like tabs versus spaces, where to place curly braces, or how many blank lines to leave between functions. But brushing off coding standards as mere style points misses the bigger picture. They’re not just about aesthetics—they’re about clarity, consistency, and collaboration. For me, if I had to pick just one software engineering technique to boost code quality across a team or project, it would be enforcing solid coding standards.

In my first week using ESLint with VS Code, I was honestly surprised by how much I learned. ESLint didn’t just highlight errors—it explained why something was wrong or not ideal. It flagged unused variables, suggested better conditional logic, and pointed out spots where I was writing in a more C-like style instead of JavaScript best practices. At first, I’ll admit, it felt a bit like ESLint was judging me. The red squiggles everywhere were overwhelming. But over time, it stopped feeling like criticism and started feeling more like mentorship built into my editor.

Soon, I could predict what ESLint would catch. My code got cleaner and easier to read. I started following JavaScript norms without even thinking about it. ESLint wasn’t just a checker—it was teaching me. It helped me transition from writing "code that works" to writing code that's also maintainable and understandable by others.

That’s the thing about good coding standards—they’re not just about format. They shape how we think when we write code. They create a shared language across a team. When everyone follows the same structure and conventions, I don’t have to waste time decoding someone else's personal style. I can just focus on what the code is doing.

Think of it like writing a book. If every chapter were written by a different person with a totally different tone, grammar, and punctuation style, it would be jarring to read. Coding standards bring that cohesion, so the whole project feels unified—even if it’s built by many hands.

Of course, using ESLint wasn’t always smooth sailing. Like going to the gym, or learning an instrument, it was uncomfortable at first. But discomfort is usually where growth happens. Those little annoyances were signals that I was leveling up my habits. Eventually, the rules that felt like constraints started to feel intuitive.

And let’s not forget—coding standards go beyond formatting. They include naming conventions, function structure, documentation style, and error handling practices. When a project has solid standards—and tools like ESLint or Prettier to reinforce them—it becomes more secure, more flexible, and easier to maintain. You don’t have to memorize every rule because the tooling guides you.

In the end, I think coding standards are one of the most underappreciated pillars of good development. They aren’t just about avoiding arguments over tabs and spaces. They help us write smarter code, learn faster, and collaborate better. That’s why I believe following coding standards isn't optional—it’s essential if you want to grow as a developer.
